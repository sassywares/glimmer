## Getting Started

Create a new repo using ✨ Glimmer as a template.

Then, it's just a Next.js app with a few extra goodies:

```bash

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the development server
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Run the production build
pnpm start

# Run unit tests
pnpm test
pnpm test:watch

# Run E2E tests
pnpm e2e
pnpm e2e:watch

# Lint the codebase
pnpm lint

# Format the codebase
pnpm format

```

## Deployment

For now, I don't have any specifics on deployment, so I'm just gonna copy and paste the Next.js deployment docs here:

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

That wraps up ✨ Glimmer (so far), there is a lot more coming, please stay tuned and stay sassy!
